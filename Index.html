          <p>To be, or not to be: that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the 
            slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by
             opposing end them?
             To die: to sleep; no more; and, by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache
              and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be
             wish'd. To die, to sleep; to sleep: </p>

          <p>perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; for in that sleep 
            of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause. 
            There's the respect that makes calamity of so long a life; <br>

            for who would bear the whips and

             the law's delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes,
              when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin?</p>
